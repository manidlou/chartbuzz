chartbuzz
=========

[chartbuzz](https://manidlou.github.io/chartbuzz) is [React](https://reactjs.org/) app that can be used to create charts (powered by [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/)) quickly and easily. You can import your data from different file types including `.xlsx` and `.csv`.

It is already up and running and everyone is welcome to use it! However, it is a work in progress meaning whenever I find some time, I'll add new features and improve current functionalities, if required. Any help is welcome!
